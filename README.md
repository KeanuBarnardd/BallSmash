# BallSmash
Ball Smash was my first completed Project published in 2018 to the IOS app store made with Unity. It was a simple 2D game in which 2 walls would be on the left and right side of the screen. Balls would then fall down the center of the screen in one of two colours. The player would then have to swipe the ball in the direction of the wall that matches the same colour; to smash the ball and gain a point. As the game progressed the balls fell faster. Unfortunately the app is not available on the app store anymore, but you can still replicate it by downloading these files.
